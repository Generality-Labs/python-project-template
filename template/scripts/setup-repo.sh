# Apply this repo's GitHub settings and rulesets: settings-as-code for the
# things GitHub keeps in the UI/API rather than in checked-in files.
#
#   1. .github/repo-settings.json is sent verbatim as the body of
#      PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}, so any key that endpoint accepts can be
#      set there (merge methods, delete_branch_on_merge, has_wiki, ...).
#      Full key list: https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/repos#update-a-repository
#   2. Every ruleset JSON in .github/rulesets/ is created if absent, or
#      updated in place when a ruleset with the same name already exists.
#      The JSON is the shape the GitHub UI imports and exports
#      (Settings -> Rules -> Rulesets), so it round-trips through the dashboard.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run after editing any of the JSON files. Needs `gh`
# authenticated as a repo admin, and `jq`.
#
# The rulesets API is plan-gated for private repos (Free plan: 403 "Upgrade to
# GitHub Pro..."). The script applies the plain settings, says so, and exits 0
# so it can sit in a setup checklist without failing it.
#
# Usage (against the repo of the current checkout):
#   scripts/setup-repo.sh

Applied. Settings that stay manual:
  - GitHub environments and their reviewers/secrets (e.g. the 'pypi'
    environment used by publish.yml for trusted publishing)
  - required status checks only take effect once the named check has run at
    least once on the repository
